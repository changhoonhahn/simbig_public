SIMulation-Based Inference of Galaxies
======================================
``SimBIG`` is a forward modeling framework for extracting cosmological information 
from the 3D spatial distribution of galaxies. 
It uses simulation-based inference (SBI) to perform highly efficient cosmological parameter 
inference using neural density estimation from machine learning.
``SimBIG`` enables us to leverage high-fidelity simulations that model the full details 
of the observed galaxy distribution and robustly analyze higher-order clustering
on small, non-linear, scales, beyond current standard analyses.

In |letter|_ we analyzed the galaxy power spectrum from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-III 
|boss|_ and demonstrated that they can rigorously analyze galaxy clustering down to smaller
scales than ever before and extract more cosmological information than current
standard anlayses.
In upcoming papers (Hahn *et al.* in prep, Lemos *et al.* in prep, Régaldo-Saint Blancard
*et al.* in prep), we will present cosmological constraints from the ``SimBIG`` analysese 
of higher-order clustering.

Forward Model
-------------

The ``SimBIG`` forward model is based on the high-resolution |quijote| 
*N*-body simulations that accurately model non-linear structure formation.
It uses a flexible state-of-the-art halo occupation model to model the 
galaxy-halo connection. 
It includes survey realism and observational systematics 
(*e.g.* survey geometry, masking, fiber collisions).
For details of the forward model, see |video|_ and |mocha|_.
